# Cupertino for Obsidian

Cupertino is a theme that brings native experience to Obsidian.

## Features

- Designed for Apple devices and Windows — native look and feel with redesigned modals, menu, Spotlight search, and more
- Comfortable spacing — widen spacing across all panels, files, components, for better usability
- Minimal interface — auto-hidden tabs & options, new mobile editor header, auto focus mode
- Windows mode — optimized for Windows with Fluent UI and pseudo-Mica effect (requires plugin)

## Plugins

All features are enable by default, [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) is **_not_** required. Only install if you wish to turn off some features you don't like.

You can optionally install [Cupertino Helper](https://github.com/aaaaalexis/obsidian-cupertino-helper/) to:

- Fix misaligned window control buttons on macOS
- Add pseudo-Mica (wallpaper as background) on Windows

## Philosophy

I’ve spent way too much time on customizing Obsidian, thousands of themes with millions of customizations, I believe a lot people do it too. It’s anti-productivity at this point, we need something that just works and is pleasant to use.

1. You _could_, but you do not _have_ to install any plugin to use Cupertino. — Use plugins to disable features instead of enable. Cupertino works out of the box.
2. The less customizations the better — Cupertino will never have customization. More customization make you waste more time on fiddling.
3. Minimalize visual noise, content is the key. — Obsidian's presence is minimized by blending into system style, so you can focus on what you're typing.

Cupertino is designed as I use Obsidian, while I'm trying to focus on being consistent, inconsistency happens. If you spot any, feel free to submit issues.
