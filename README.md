## Philosophy

I’ve spent way too much time on customizing Obsidian, thousands of themes with millions of customizations, I believe a lot people do it too. It’s anti-productivity at this point, we need something that just works and is pleasant to use.

1. You _could_, but you do not _have_ to install any plugin to use Cupertino. — Use plugins to disable features instead of enable. Cupertino works out of the box.
2. The less customizations the better — Cupertino will never have customization. More customization make you waste more time on fiddling.
3. Minimalize visual noise, content is the key. — Obsidian's presence is minimized by blending into system style, so you can focus on what you're typing.

Cupertino is designed as I use Obsidian, while I'm trying to focus on being consistent, inconsistency happens. If you spot any, feel free to submit issues.
